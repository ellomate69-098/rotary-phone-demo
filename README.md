# rotary-phone-demo
This is a bookmarklet to disable lightspeed blocking and goguardian, just import the raw code url into this and replace the | :
javascript:fetch(`|`).then(data=>{data.text().then(text=>{eval(text)})});
I DID NOT CREATE THIS!!!! I just made a version for people in my school! 
visit the creator here > https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover
Let me know if you would like me to create a remix for the extentions you would like disabled! I would be happy to, please just leave a comment.
